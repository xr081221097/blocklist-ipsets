# [Abuse.ch Ransomware Tracker] 
# (https://ransomwaretracker.abuse.ch) Ransomware Tracker 
# tracks and monitors the status of domain names, IP 
# addresses and URLs that are associated with Ransomware, 
# such as Botnet C&C servers, distribution sites and payment 
# sites. By using data provided by Ransomware Tracker, 
# hosting- and internet service provider (ISPs), as well as 
# national CERTs/CSIRTs, law enforcement agencies (LEA) and 
# security researchers can receive an overview on 
# infrastructure used by Ransomware and whether these are 
# actively being used by miscreants to commit fraud. The IPs 
# in this list have been extracted from the tracker data 
# feed, filtering only online IPs.
